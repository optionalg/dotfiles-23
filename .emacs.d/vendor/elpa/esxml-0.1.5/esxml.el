;;; Commentary:

;; This is XML/XHTML done with S-Expressions in EmacsLisp.  Simply,
;; this is the easiest way to write HTML or XML in Lisp.
;;
;; This library uses the native form of XML representation as used by
;; many libraries already included within emacs.  This representation
;; will be referred to as "esxml" throughout this library.  See
;; `esxml-to-xml' for a concise description of the format.
;;
;; This library is not intended to be used directly by a user, though
;; it certainly could be.  It could be used to generate static html,
;; or use a library like `elnode' to serve dynamic pages.  Or even to
;; extract a form from a site to produce an API.
;;
;; TODO: Better documentation, more conveniance.

end of the string.  Leaves all other whitespace untouched."

;; While the following could certainly have been written using format,
;; concat makes them easier to read.  Update later if neccesary for
;; efficiency.

;; Though at first glance the recursive nature of this function might
;; give one pause, since xml is a recursive data type, a recursive
;; parser is an optimal strategy.  each node will be visited exactly
;; once during the transformation.
;;
;; Further, since a string is a terminal node and since xml can be
;; represented as a string, non dynamic portions of the page may be
;; precached quite easily.
(defun esxml-to-xml (esxml)
  "This translates an esxml expression, i.e. that which is
returned by xml-parse-region.  The structure is defined as a
string or a list where the first element is the tag the second is
an alist of attribute value pairs and the remainder of the list
is 0 or more esxml elements.

 (TAG ATTRS &rest BODY) || STRING

TAG: is the tag and must be a symbol.

ATTRS: is an alist of attribute pairs each pair must be of the
       form (KEY . VALUE).

KEY: is the name of the attribute and must be a symbol.

VALUE: is the value of the attribute and must be a string.

BODY: is zero or more esxml expressions.  Having no body forms
      implies that the tag should be self closed.  If there is
      one or more body forms the tag will always be explicitly
      closed, even if they are the empty string.

STRING: if the esxml expression is a string it is returned
        unchanged, this allows for caching of any constant parts,
        such as headers and footers.
